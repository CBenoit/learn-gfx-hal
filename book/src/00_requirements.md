# Requirements

I assume that you have basic familiarity with Rust. So go read [The Rust
Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) if you haven't ever done that.

We will also be touching upon elements of `unsafe` Rust, and so you should also
read [The Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/) if you have not.

I don't assume you have any graphics programming skills. I sure don't have any.
