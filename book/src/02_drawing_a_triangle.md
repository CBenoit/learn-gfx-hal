# Drawing A Triangle

This part will be the most difficult part out of all of them.

Unfortunately, for you, and I, and for everyone else, `gfx-hal` has a rather
intense upfront word cost. Adding more as you go isn't pricey, but that first
triangle covers a whole lot of ground at once. This is a land of maximum
control, and unfortunately we can't just say "gimme a good default setup and
I'll change the settings later". By the end of this lesson we'll have expanded
our code from ~40 lines to ~700 lines.

## Adding in `gfx-hal` and a backend

First, we have to add the `gfx-hal` crate to our `Cargo.toml` file. We also need
to pick a backend crate. Remember that the "hal" in `gfx-hal` is for "Hardware
Abstraction Layer". So `gfx-hal` just provides the general types and operations,
then each backend actually implements the details according to the hardware API
it's abstracting over.

Since we want it to be something you can pick per-compile, we're going to use a
big pile of features and optional dependencies:

```toml
[features]
default = []
metal = ["gfx-backend-metal"]
dx12 = ["gfx-backend-dx12"]
vulkan = ["gfx-backend-vulkan"]

[dependencies]
winit = "0.18"
gfx-hal = "0.1"

[dependencies.gfx-backend-vulkan]
version = "0.1"
optional = true

[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")'.dependencies.gfx-backend-metal]
version = "0.1"
optional = true

[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies.gfx-backend-dx12]
version = "0.1"
optional = true
```

If you want RLS to play nice with the various optional features you must tell it
which one to use for its compilations. If you're using VS Code with the RLS
plugin, instead of messing up your `Cargo.toml` by specifying a default feature
you can instead make a `.vscode/settings.json` file in your project folder and
then place a setting for the feature you want it to use for RLS runs. Something
like this:

```json
{
  "rust.features": [
    "dx12"
  ]
}
```

If you're using RLS with some editor besides VS Code I'm afraid I don't know the
details of how you tell it to use a particular feature, but you probably can.
Consult your plugin docs, and such.

Over inside our main file we put some conditional stuff at the top:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "dx12")]
extern crate gfx_backend_dx12 as back;
#[cfg(feature = "metal")]
extern crate gfx_backend_metal as back;
#[cfg(feature = "vulkan")]
extern crate gfx_backend_vulkan as back;
extern crate gfx_hal as hal;
```

Yes, in the 2018 edition it's not _strictly necessary_ to have `extern crate`
any more, but making the shorthand alias names is very nice, so we'll do it like
this.

Finally, before we go on, I'll mention that there _are_ other backend options
that we haven't considered:

* [gfx-backend-empty](https://crates.io/crates/gfx-backend-empty) does nothing
  but provide the required implementations as `unimplemented!()`. You might use
  this with RLS or something, but you can't actually draw a picture with it.
* [gfx-backend-gl](https://crates.io/crates/gfx-backend-gl) lets you target
  OpenGL 2.1+ and OpenGL ES2+. You'd probably use this if you wanted to run in a
  webpage, or perhaps on a Raspberry Pi (which has OpenGL ES2 drivers, but not
  Vulkan), or something like that where you couldn't pick one of the main
  options. Unfortunately, the GL backend is actually a little busted at the
  moment. The biggest snag is that webpages and desktop apps have rather
  different control flow, so it's hard to come up with a unified API. Work is
  being done, and hopefully soon I'll be able to recommend the GL backend.
