# learn-gfx-hal

Step by step tutorials for using the `gfx-hal` crate.

The tutorials all target the current version _on crates.io_, not on the master
branch of git. At the time of me writing this that means `0.1.0`.

This is _not_ a library crate for you to import into your own projects. It is a
book and examples for you read and learn from.

* Fully working examples are in the `examples/` directory.
* The rendered version of the book text is on the [GitHub Pages
  site](https://gfx-rs.github.io/learn-gfx-hal/).

The primary ~~author~~ quixotic fool of the project is me, Lokathor. I manage to
explain things in a way that beginners can understand by not actually knowing
anything myself. If there are mistakes that have crept into the document please
file an issue. You also attempt to contact me interactively on the `#gamedev`
channel of the [community discord](https://bit.ly/rust-community).
